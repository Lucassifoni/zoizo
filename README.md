Code for the Elixir-controlled telescope project presented here : https://lucassifoni.info/blog/prototyping-elixir-telescope-code-beam/

The repo still lacks a few commits that I need to gather on other machines. Since presenting it, my hobby time took a serious hit, but I'm not done with this project.
